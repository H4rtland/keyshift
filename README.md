# keyshift

A simple game about pressing the right keys at the right time. But the keys move.

Press the correct key as a blip is passing over to destroy the blip. Let too many blips escape and the game ends. Destroy 15 blips to move on to the next game mode and replenish your lives, alongside a key shuffle.
